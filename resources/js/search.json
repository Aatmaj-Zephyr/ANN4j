The package provides various functionalities for observing individual neurons and particular layers in multilayer perceptrons. Since every neuron, layer and model in ANN4j is an object of its own, implementation of new operations and algorithms on them can be done without much effort. Research on new algorithms can be done without the need for translation of the operations into matrix format. This package can be used to train models on various datasets. ANN4j provides functionality for extension of inbuilt file readers for reading from new formats of input data files. The ease of use and flexibility of this package makes it ideal for research and development of multilayer perceptrons in java.","Please consider following me on github\uD83D\uDE04"]},{"l":"READ COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION HERE"},{"l":"Source code HERE"},{"l":"Table of Contents","p":["About","ANN4j Community","Asking for help","Cite","Clases and Methods","Class Diagram","Community","Constructor","Contributing","Data Format","Default Format","Design","Design Patterns","Documentation- Examples","Download","Evaluating the model","Explanable AI","Features","Future Scope","Getting Input","Getting Input Neuron values","Getting Label","Getting Output Neuron values","Getting prediction from the output neurons","Help spread the word","License","Observable Methods","Other Format","Other Resources","Output","Parameters","Raising an issue","Requirements and Dependancies","Restarting the FileReader","Training","Training the Model","Usage"]},{"l":"About"},{"i":"ann4j---creating-observable-object-oriented-neural-networks-for-better-explainable-ai","l":"ANN4j - Creating observable object-oriented neural networks for better Explainable AI.","p":["ANN4j is a java package that provides object oriented functionality to neural networks. It implements multilayer perceptrons in java by using Objects instead of matrix multiplications. Every neuron is treated as a separate object. While this kind of implementation is highly inefficient when compared to matrix multiplications, this implementation will help research in the fields of Explainable AI. Explainable AI aims at making the model interpretable. By pausing and observing the neural net at different stages, researchers can study neural networks more efficiently. Individual observable interfaces are more easy to observe then matrices. Operations which are difficult to perform on matrices can be performed more easily using this technique."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Observable implementation for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)","XAI method for relevance propagation","Stochastic/batch gradient descent","No hardcoded implementations lets researchers change the parameters as they want.","Plug and play mnist type data.

Operations like forwardpropagation and backpropagation are encoded at each of these levels using superclass-subclass polymorphism. Neurons inherit special observable properties. These make it possible to observe these neurons whenever any of their parameters change. Control over the various functions has been controlled by the use of template pattern on the Trainer class by providing standard sequence of algorithms. However there is provision that any of the algorithms can be used, altered and researched upon as per requirement. The overall design of the package makes it very flexible to use. For example, strategy pattern used for neuron behaviors make it possible to add custom algorithms for setting the value of delta difference between neurons. New algorithms can be tested by inheriting class neuron and making appropriate changes in the custom implementation of algorithms.

There are so many tried and tested tools and technologies that already are training neural networks in an effective manner. Then for what reason one must use a language like Java and a slow ineffective package made by some unknown person? The answer to this question is because the purpose of ANN4j is very different from other libraries available in popular languages like python or R. ANN4j is not a tool that you should use for your next ML project. ANN4j does not aim at making neural networks effective to train neither does it strive for providing an industry standard interface. The purpose of ANN4j is solely to help researchers. ANN4j is a tool for performing Proof-Of-Concept research on neural networks. ANN4j makes it easy to design and test new algorithms on neural networks. This is possible due to the OOP concepts used in this package. The OOP concepts make it extremely easy for anyone to use, modify the Neural Network algorithms. This is not possible in other libraries. For example you cannot easily replace the backpropagation algorithm in TenserFlow with your custom algorithm. Another important advantage of ANN4j is its Object Oriented implementation. How does that help? ANN4j treats every neuron as an object, not as an element in a matrix. This means that if you want to access specific neurons, perform custom complicated algorithms on a specific set of neurons, you can easily do so. You wont need to translate it into a matrix calculation. Lets take example of forward propagation.","Actual concept:","image","Matrix calculation:","ANN4j implimentation:","As you can see, the ANN4j implementation is very similar to the actual concept.
