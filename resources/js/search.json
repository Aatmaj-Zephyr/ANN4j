[[{"l":"README"},{"i":"ann4j---artificial-neural-networks-for-java","l":"ANN4j - Artificial Neural Networks for Java","p":["ANN4j is a package that provides Object Oriented implementation of Artificial Neural Networks in java for exploration and analysis of neural networks and their algorithms. The package provides various functionalities for observing indivisual neurons and particular layers in multilayer perceptrons. Since every neuron, layer and model in ANN4j is an object of its own, implementation of new operations and algorithms on them can be done without much effort. Research on new algorithms can be done without the need for translation of the operations into matrix format. This package can be used to train models on various datasets. ANN4j provides functionality for extension of inbuilt file readers for reading from new formats of input data files. The ease of use and flexibility of this package makes it ideal for research and development of multilayer perceptrons in java."]},{"l":"READ COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION HERE"},{"l":"Table of Contents","p":["About","ANN4j Community","Asking for help","Cite","Clases and Methods","Class Diagram","Community","Constructor","Contributing","Data Format","Default Format","Design","Design Patterns","Documentation- Examples","Download","Evaluating the model","Explanable AI","Features","Getting Input","Getting Input Neuron values","Getting Label","Getting Output Neuron values","Getting prediction from the output neurons","Help spread the word","License","Observable Methods","Other Format","Other Resources","Output","Parameters","Raising an issue","Requirements and Dependancies","Restarting the FileReader","Training","Training the Model","Usage"]},{"l":"About"},{"i":"ann4j---creating-observable-object-oriented-neural-networks-for-better-explainable-ai","l":"ANN4j - Creating observable object-oriented neural networks for better Explainable AI.","p":["ANN4j is a java package that provides object oriented functionality to neural networks. It implements multilayer perceptrons in java by using Objects instead of matrix multiplications. Every neuron is treated as a seperate object. While this kind of implementation is highly inefficiant when compared to matrix multiplications, this implementation will help research in the fields of Explainable AI. Explainable AI aims at making the model interpretable. By pausing and observing the neural net at different stages, researchers can study neural networks more efficiantly. Indivisual observable interfaces are more easy to observe then matrices. Operations which are difficult to perform on matrices can be performed more easily using this technique."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Observable implementation for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)","XAI method for relevance propagation","Stochastic/batch gradient descent","No hardcoded implementations lets researchers change the parameters as they want.","Plug and play mnist type data.
